This directory contains train-validation-test datasets created from the Bangla-Lekha-Isolated dataset for our project's experimentation. The dataset was split into train and test set in 80:20 ratio and the train set was further split into 80:20 - train:validation sets. All split was done keeping the score labels(1 to 5) stratified.

'scoreLabel_val.csv' contains score_labels of each validation sample.

'scoreLabel_test.csv' contains score_labels of each test sample.

Folders- 'train_images', 'validation_images' and 'test_images' contains sample images for the training, validation and test set respectively.
